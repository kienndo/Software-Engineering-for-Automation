# Original project proposal 
## Description
Planning a vacation for a large group can be overwhelming, with numerous suggestions to consider, expenses to track, and logistics to coordinate. As we have encountered this problem several times ourselves, we want to find a solution that gathers a lot of necessary and useful functionalities, creating an efficient platform for all participants of the vacation.

## Scope
The project will implement a travel planning platform in the form of a website to gather all the functionalities that can be necessary and useful to plan a vacation. This is done by creating a database-driven website with multiple pages, making the process easy, clear, and comfortable for all participants in the trip. Our vision is to include functionalities such as

* Itinerary: This will include a calendar with an overview of the different activities. Each trip will mainly choose one travel leader with administrator permission, but solutions such as suggestions and voting possibilities will allow other inputs.
* Budget and payment settlement: An overview of the expenses of the trip with diagrams and a payment settlement that shows how much different people are in debt / have paid through the trip. In addition, a currency converter can be implemented.
* Responsibilities: Checklist of different responsibilities and things to be done.
* Map: Overview of places to be visited, hotel, restaurants, etc.
* Memories: A place where all participants can share pictures they took during the trip and possibly make comments.
* Personal profile: An overview of past and future travels you have participate in, a profile picture, information about yourself, etc.

## Environment
To make the website, our approach will be to use HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend, Django for the backend, and SQL for the database.
